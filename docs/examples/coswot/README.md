# COSWOT-ACIMOV report examples

Here are examples of reports generated by olivaw on the COSWOT-ACIMOV project

You can check the [COSWOT turtle model report](./model-test-manual-NicoRobertIn-2024-06-05T16-20-54.ttl) and the [COSWOT markdown model report](./model-test-manual-NicoRobertIn-2024-06-05T16-20-54.md)

It was tested on hash `1ea6ad8e0d2d5adb5ec4094239509b8cbac32394`

In order to make the report viewable from github, some options have been enabled in order to make these reports short enough.

The command used was `olivaw test model --SKIP-PASS --TESTED-ONLY`

Here is the `parameters.json` used for the test:

```json
{
    "ontology_prefix": "coswot",
    "ontology_namespace": "https://w3id.org/coswot/",
    "term_distance_threshold": 3,
    "blocking_errors": [
        "syntax-error",
        "owl-rl-constraint-violation"
    ],
    "gist_index": "",
    "skipped_errors": [],
    "skipped_tests": [],
    "skipped_subjects": ["all-modules", "all-fragments"],
