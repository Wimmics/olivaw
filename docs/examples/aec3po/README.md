# AEC3PO report examples

Here are examples of reports generated by olivaw on the [AEC3PO project](https://github.com/Accord-Project/aec3po).

These reports have been generated by a development version of olivaw that corresponds to version `v0.0.5`.

It was tested on hash `ee306c5c2e216f30e0e3b918b46f9ec82fdfeaf1`

In order to fully match the folder naming convention that was decided for olivaw frameork, these rename has been made:

* `./examples` -> `./use-cases/`

In order to make the report viewable from github, some options have been enabled in order to make these reports short enough.

The command used was `olivaw test model --SKIP-PASS`.

Here is the `parameters.json` used for the test:

```json
{
    "ontology_prefix": "aec3po",
    "ontology_namespace": "https://w3id.org/lbd/aec3po/",
    "term_distance_threshold": 3,
    "blocking_errors": [
        "syntax-error",
        "owl-rl-constraint-violation"
    ],
    "gist_index": "",
    "skipped_errors": [],
